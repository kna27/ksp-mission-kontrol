# ksp-mission-kontrol

## Introduction

This is a Kerbal Space Program plugin that:

1. Exports telemetry data (altitude, velocity, etc.) from your craft to a .csv file
2. Creates charts in a webpage for you to view, like a real-life mission control

This mod allows you to roleplay Mission Control at real launches. You can have the webpage on another screen, or even another device, as the webpage is hosted on your IP. Any device on the same network can connect and view the webpage.

## Reporting Bugs

The current version of the mod is **DEV ONLY**, do not download unless you know what you are doing.

As such, do not report any bugs. I know that there are a lot,  and I am getting to them. As soon as an official build is made, feel free to report any bugs you find.

## Installation
This mod only works on Windows.
1. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), any recent version should be fine.
2. Download the GameData/KSPMissionKontrol folder.
3. Copy the KSPMissionKontrol folder to `YourKSPInstallDirectory/Kerbal Space Program/GameData`
 
Your directory should look like: `YourKSPInstallDirectory/Kerbal Space Program/GameData/KSPMissionKontrol` if done correctly.
